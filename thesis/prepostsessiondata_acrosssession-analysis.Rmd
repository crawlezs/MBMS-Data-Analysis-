The second analysis will be a linear mixed model of PANAS and IOS scores across the individual sessions, from Start (0) to End (1). 

**Steps of analysis:**
1. Load data frame of Start data
2. Create variable of change across session
2. Run descriptive statistics of change in panas_pos, panas_neg, and ios
    a. Score means by Session
    b. Score means by ID
    c. Boxplot of Scores over Session, by ID
    d. QQ plot of Scores over Session, by ID
    e. Check for outliers 
    f. Check for normality 
3. Run repeated measures ANOVA to establish significant difference between scores across individual sessions
    a. gather data frame by time
    b. run anova with unchanged df
    c. run anova with outliers removed
4. Run Linear Mixed Models
    a. plot data 
    b. fit a mixed model
    c. calculate confidence intervals
    d. plot data with model estimate
